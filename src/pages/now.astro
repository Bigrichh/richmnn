        I’m studying towards mastering advanced software engineering and web
        development concepts. Between juggling projects and work, I’m sneaking
        in time to explore new tools, frameworks, and ways to build better user
        interfaces and experiences. I’ve also picked up books on communication,
        business & finance and self-development to round things out.

        I’ve been sticking to a simple home calisthenics routine - upper body,
        lower body, rest, repeat. It’s nothing fancy, but it keeps me active
        ,feeling and of course looking good. Aside this being one of my ways of
        practicing discipline, It’s my way of recharging after long days indoors
        designing and coding. That said, I’ve got plans to eventually hit the
        gym and chase a fitness goal that’s been hiding somewhere in one of my
        Pinterest boards for a while.

        I spent most of 2024 cooped up indoors, busy with work and study - you
        already know how it goes. This year, I’ve set a goal to step out
        more—explore new places, try different foods, meet interesting people,
        and soak in fresh experiences. Maybe I’ll even treat myself to a
        vacation this year if i'm lucky. Fingers crossed, you’ll catch these
        adventures unfold on my <a

        Outside of work and entrepreneurial experiments, I’ve always got a few
        things simmering in the background. Right now, it’s a mix of designing
        and building concepts for sass ideas and filling up my knowledge
        buckets. I’ve got a side mission to be a top chef ( and trust me - the
        kitchen is an entirely different battleground but winners never quit!).
        It’s the little things that keep life interesting.
