      <p class="text-txtsec">
        Hi - again. I’d love to tell you I didn’t always know I wanted to be a
        Software Engineer, but the truth? I’ve always known and frankly speaking
        it’s been a journey of curiosity, trial and a LOT of failures that
        eventually led me to some successes. On the other hand I had no idea I’d
        ever become a product designer - especially since empathy which is a big
        part of product design isn’t exactly my strongest suit. It still doesn’t
        take away from the fact that I’ve had an eye for design for as long as I
        can remember - from second grade when my art teacher praised me for
        having a good eye for patterns to the random anime characters I used to
        draw in middle school to now where I paint as a hobby. I never saw
        myself walking the path that led to design, yet here I am. Back then, I
        couldn’t explain why certain colors just worked or why arranging things
        in a particular way felt so satisfying. It wasn’t until I started
        learning the principles of design that I realized there’s a method to
        creating those results. Now, I get to combine that instinct with skill,
        turning ideas into clean and functional realities but that’s just by the
        way.
      </p>
      <p class="text-txtsec">
        I’ll spare you the typical childhood story about being fascinated with
        computers and how the TV remote worked - even though there’s some degree
        of truth to this - but the fact is, my interest lies in why certain
        products look good. Why they keep their users coming back and what makes
        them so much more engaging than others and how I can replicate this to
        solve problems. It’s not something I obsess over, but good design WILL
        make me stop and pay attention to the details. While I appreciate the
        value of standardized ‘UX principles,’ I like to go deeper, exploring
        these ideas through books, observation, and just paying attention to
        what makes a product feel right.
      </p>
      <p class="text-txtsec">
        I didn’t start out in a fancy design studio or as part of a big
        engineering team. I started like most people - with self-doubt,
        countless late nights, books books books and more Googling and Chat
        GPTing in my room than I’d like to admit. But somewhere along late
        nights spent working on my craft, I realized that I loved solving
        problems and building systems, especially the kind of problems that
        impact real people when they’re solved. The kind of solutions that make
        someone’s life just a little easier, their work a little smoother, or
        their experience a little bit better.
      </p>
      <p class="text-txtsec">
        I won’t pretend to be the biggest people person. Blame it on the
        introvert in my ambiverted nature - let’s face it, humans can be a pain
        sometimes. But over the years, I’ve come to deeply appreciate the human
        side of what I do. Sure, I build websites, apps, and tools, but it’s
        never just about the code or the design. At the core, it’s about the
        people who use them. Every project I take on reflects a simple belief:
        technology should serve, not overwhelm. It’s not about flashy features
        or overly complex solutions - it’s about creating something that
        genuinely makes life better for the next person, even in small ways.
      </p>
      <p class="text-txtsec">
        I’ve worked hard to carve out a space for myself where two worlds meet:
        the creative and the technical. Design and development. For me, design
        is rooted in empathy - a skill I had to consciously learn. It’s about
        stepping into someone else’s shoes and understanding their needs -
        seeing through their eyes. Development, though, is where that empathy
        comes alive. It’s where ideas take shape. I get to take concepts that
        once seemed impossible and turn them into reality - one feature, one
        function, and one thoughtful detail at a time
      </p>
      <p class="text-txtsec">
        This journey hasn’t been without its challenges. There were moments of
        doubt, days when things didn’t work no matter how many hours I poured
        into them, and sleepless nights spent trying to balance work, study, and
        the pursuit of self-improvement. Yet, every struggle has taught me
        something invaluable. It’s shown me resilience. It’s taught me to trust
        the process, to adapt in this ever changing eco system of tech, and to
        push boundaries - not just for myself but for the people who will use
        what I create. For the people I work for and with.
      </p>
      <p class="text-txtsec">
        Outside of work, I’m just human - flawed, curious, and figuring things
        out like everyone else. I overthink (not as often but sometimes way too
        much for my own good). By default, I’m a pretty laid-back guy. I work
        hard, and I fail more often than I’d like to admit. But that’s life,
        isn’t it? I stumble, I fall, but I pick myself up, learn from the
        experience, and keep moving forward. Also, let’s be real - good food
        will always have a piece of my heart (and yes, I’d absolutely sell our
        friendship for it). Right now, I’m chasing somebody’s daughter, trying
        to navigate love like the rest of us. I’m a sucker for good books,
        Pinterest boards full of inspiration, and, of course, Chelsea - the
        greatest football team in the world (don’t argue; it’s just facts). I’ve
        got this thing for dressing sharp and looking good, not just for the
        sake of appearance but for the sake of appearance ... you get it? Most
        of the time, you’ll find me in my room, probably working or plotting my
        next big idea. But I’m working on stepping outside my comfort zone -
        literally. Exploring the world, meeting new people, and soaking in
        everything life has to offer is something I’m striving for. Anime? Let
        me tell you, it’s more than just entertainment. There’s so much depth,
        emotion, and storytelling to learn from if you give it a chance. It’s a
        shame more people don’t see that. At the end of the day, I’m just a
        chill guy - trying to survive, learn, adapt, and win at this thing
        called life. It’s messy, unpredictable, and sometimes exhausting, but I
        wouldn’t trade the journey for anything. We’re all just figuring it out,
        one day at a time, and that’s the beauty of it.
      </p>
      <p class="text-txtsec">
        This portfolio? It’s not just a showcase of what I can do - it’s a part
        of me. I don’t claim to have it all figured out, but I’m committed to
        growth - to learning through every project especially where I fall short
        because no matter how “Senior” I get there’ll always something I don’t
        know and that’s a humbling thought. I’m here for every mistake and every
        challenge because that’s where growth starts. If you’ve made it this
        far, thank you. Thank you for taking the time to see the person behind
        the work.
