        I’m a product designer & software engineer(primarily focused on web
        development) - I design best-in-class user experiences and I build the
        technology bringing those experiences to life. By day, I work with

          class="underline text-txtprim hover:text-txtsec">Utopia Tech</a
        > as a Software Engineer, and by night, I juggle design and development contracts,
        personal projects, and side hustles - ranging from entrepreneurial experiments
        to designing and building software products solving real-world problems.
        This is my humble corner of the web - here, you’ll find a collection of professional
        and personal work, UI/UX explorations, and software projects. Find all of
